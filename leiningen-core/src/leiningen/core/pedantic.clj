(ns leiningen.core.pedantic
  "This namespace exists to hook into Aether's dependency
  resolution and provide feedback about the dependency tree. Using a
  `DependencyGraphTransformer` allows us to look at the tree both before
  and after conflict resolution so that downloading all of the
  dependencies only occurs once.

  Aether uses a `NearestVersionConflictResolver` to resolve which
  versions to use in case of a conflict. The
  `NearestVersionConflictResolver` uses a `ConflictIdSorter` to
  determine those, and it will save the information in
  `SORTED_CONFLICT_IDS` and `CONFLICT_IDS`. We can similarly use the
  conflict information to determine which version is choosen in a
  conflict.

  Additional important classes from Aether:

  * `DependencyGraphTransformationContext`
  * `DependencyNode`
  * `Dependency`
  * `Artifact`
  * `Version`
  * `VersionConstraint`"
