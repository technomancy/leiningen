"'Managed Dependencies' are a concept borrowed from maven pom files; see
https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Management

Managed dependencies allow you to specify a desired version number for a dependency
*if* the dependency exists (often transitively), but a managed dependency
will not actually cause the described artifact to be a dependency on its own.
This feature is most useful in combination with some other mechanism for
defining a \"parent project\"; e.g. you can have a \"parent project\" that specifies
managed dependencies for common libraries that you use frequently in your other
projects, and then the downstream/child projects can specify a normal dependency on
those libraries *without specifying a version number*, and thus will inherit
the version number from the parent.  This provides a simpler means of keeping
common dependency versions in sync across a large number of clojure libraries.

For more info see ./doc/MANAGED_DEPS.md and https://github.com/achin/lein-parent

Example:

  :managed-dependencies [[clj-time \"0.12.0\"]
