* Source, test, and compilation paths can be set in project.clj.

  projects that require a different version of Clojure from

* Install task no longer requires maven to be installed.

* Only compile namespaces whose .class files are older than .clj files.

* Add "new" task for generating blank projects.

* Set <scm> tag when generating pom.xml.

* Include pom.xml, pom.properties, and more detailed manifest in jars.

* Summarize pass/fail counts from test runs across all namespaces.

* Accept a list of namespaces for test task rather than testing all.

* Create $PROJECT-standalone.jar file from uberjar to distinguish from
  regular jar files.

* Plugins have more flexibility to set the classpath and other
  arguments for running project code.

* Add resources/ directory to classpath and generated jars.
