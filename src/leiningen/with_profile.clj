Comma-separated profiles may be given to merge profiles and perform the task.
Colon-separated profiles may be given for sequential profile task application.

A profile list may either be a list of profiles to use, or may specify the
profiles to add or remove from the active profile list using + or - prefixes.

For example:

     lein with-profile user,dev test
     lein with-profile -dev test
     lein with-profile +1.4:+1.4,-dev:base,user test
