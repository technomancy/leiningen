    lein deps :tree

  Show the full dependency tree for the current project. Each dependency is only
  shown once within a tree.

  Show the full dependency tree as EDN for the current project. Each dependency 
  is only shown once within a tree.

    lein deps :plugin-tree

  Show the full dependency tree for the plugins in the current project.

    lein deps :verify

  Check signatures of each dependency. ALPHA: subject to change.

    lein deps :implicits

  List the implicit middleware and hooks that will be activated by the current
  set of plugins. Useful for debugging unexplained behaviour.

    lein deps

  Force Leiningen to download the dependencies it needs. This usage is
  deprecated as it should happen automatically on demand.

  Normally snapshot dependencies will be checked once every 24 hours; to
  force them to be updated, use `lein -U $TASK`."
