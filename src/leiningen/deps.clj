(defn deps
  "Show details about dependencies.

    lein deps :tree

Show the full dependency tree for the current project. Each dependency is only
shown once within a tree.

    lein deps :tree-data

Show the full dependency tree as above, but in EDN format.

    lein deps :plugin-tree

Show the full dependency tree for the plugins in the current project.

    lein deps :verify

Check signatures of each dependency. ALPHA: subject to change.

    lein deps :implicits

List the implicit middleware and hooks that will be activated by the current
set of plugins. Useful for debugging unexplained behaviour.

    lein deps :why org.clojure/core.logic

Show just the path in the dependency tree directly relating to why a
specific dependency has been included.

    lein deps :query circleci/circleci.test 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT

Look up the version number for a dependency in the remote repositories and
print a resolved version. If omitted, the version defaults to \"RELEASE\". Can
resolve SNAPSHOT versions to timestamps.

    lein deps

Force Leiningen to download the dependencies it needs. This usage is
deprecated as it should happen automatically on demand.

Normally snapshot dependencies will be checked once every 24 hours; to
force them to be updated, use `lein -U $TASK`."
