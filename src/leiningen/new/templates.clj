;; You can write a 'new' task yourself without any extra plugins like
;; lein-newnew. What makes lein-new so useful is the `templates` task for
;; listing templates and this file. The primary problem with writing your
;; own project scaffolding tools that are domain-specific is you
;; generally have to reimplement the same things every single time. With
;; lein-new, you have this little library that your templates can use.
;; It has all the things a template is likely to need:
;; * an easy way to generate files and namespaces
;; * a way to render files written with a flexible template language
;; * a way to get those files off of the classpath transparently

;; templates on the classpath will be a function returned from this higher-order
;; function. This way, we can say the name of our template just once and our

;; and the second element as the contents to put there. If it encounters a
