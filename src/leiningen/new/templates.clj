;; You can write a 'new' task yourself without any extra plugins like
;; lein-newnew. What makes newnew so useful is the `templates` task for
;; listing templates and this file. The primary problem with writing your
;; own project scaffolding tools that are domain-specific is tht you
;; generally have to reimplement the same things every single time. With
;; lein-newnew, you have this little library that your templates can use.
;; It has all the things a template is likely to need:
;; * an easy way to generate files and namespaces
;; * a way to render files written with a flexible template language
;; * a way to get those files off of the classpath transparently

;; of templates, we don't want to have to pass the name of the template every
;; single time. We've also avoided magic so far, so a dynamic var and accompanying
;; macro to set it is not in our game plan. Instead, our function for rendering
;; templates on the classpath will be a function returned from this higher-order
;; function. This way, we can say the name of our template just once and our

;; when it sees a vector, it treats the first element as the path to spit to
;; and the second element as the contents to put there. If it encounters a
;; string, it treats it as an empty directory that should be created. Any parent
;; directories for any of our generated files and directories are created
;; automatically. All paths are considered mustache templates and are rendered
;; with our data. Of course, this doesn't effect paths that don't have templates
