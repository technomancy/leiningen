Leiningen TODOs

See also http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/issues

* Open Questions
** Aether: how would it integrate? Improvement over maven-ant-tasks?
** Tests in Nailgun: would it require a separate shell script?
** How could nonlinear versions be represented?
* For 2.0
** TODO Quit using ant's Java task. It is horrible.
   Try a custom classloader approach?
** TODO Use Aether instead of maven-ant-tasks?
   http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/08/introducing-aether/
** TODO Rename test-resources to dev-resources
   Breaking change; needs to wait for a major version bump.
** TODO add option to use ~/.m2-based classpath instead of copying to lib/?
   It looks like it would be easy to stop copying things into lib/ and
   just use Maven's notion of the project's dependencies to construct a
   classpath that references jars straight from ~/.m2.
** TODO spin lancet off into its own dependency
   I've never felt comfortable about simply keeping it inline. On the
   other hand if we quit using ant then we can skip this.
   Needs to not be in the default package!
** TODO shell wrappers should support multiple versions
   We could write out a different "foo-$VERSION" shell wrapper for each
   version of a project that gets installed and then have the plain
   "foo" script look for a $VERSION env var if it's set, and if not
   just fall back to the latest.
** TODO classifiers for specifying what clojure version to use?
   As more versions of Clojure start to exist, libraries may want to
   publish different branches that target different versions of
   Clojure itself. Classifiers may be the way to separate these out?
** TODO a list of dirs to include in the jar when building
   Some people have requested this.
** TODO re-compile all deps with current clojure version
   Another thing that's going to start becoming more important as more
   Clojure versions are introduced.
** TODO fail gracefully when run without an Internet connection (Issue #100)
** TODO improve test coverage
** TODO merge push task based on clj-ssh
   lein-clojars task doesn't support DSA keys
** TODO integrate plugin task with lein-search
   Would be better to be able to leave off version numbers
** TODO add search functionality based on standard mvn lucene indexes
   lein-search is cool, but it would be better to interoperate with
   the standard lucene index system that Maven repositories offer.
   This would also mean getting Clojars to produce those indices.
* For 1.4
** DONE socket timing issues with interactive tests
** DONE connect to socket repl in interactive task
** DONE :uberjar-exclusions?
** DONE :all test-selector built-in
** DONE test selectors need to support things like constantly, complement
** DONE detect missing level of nesting in project.clj's deps/dev-deps
** DONE clear out non-transitive .class files after AOT
   Luc Prefontaine has code for this.
** DONE plugin task for managing/upgrading plugins
   Manually copying jar files into ~/.lein/plugins is pretty
   lame. Let's get a task to handle this. It could be implemented as a
   plugin at first, maybe.
** DONE merge lein-run task?
   Ditto; this is something useful that many projects need.
** DONE expose original pwd as property
** DONE merge lein-javac task
   Also make the compile task run it where appropriate.
** DONE test selectors using metadata; run a subset of tests
   We could have a :test-selectors key in project.clj that would map
   keywords to predicate functions. Then the test task could take a
   keyword argument and only run the subset of the tests for which
   calling the predicate on its metadata returns true.
* For 1.3.0
** DONE specify min. lein version in project.clj
** DONE :omit-source
** DONE lein install $PROJECT (works outside project root)
   Possibly take some of this from cljr?
** DONE write shell wrappers on install
** DONE include shell wrapper in jar file from template
** DONE set arbitrary jar metadata
** DONE errors in read-project should show filename
** DONE user-level plugin installation and activation
** DONE user-level config file (with hook list)
** DONE get no-project-needed from arglist
** DONE argument chaining
** DONE interactive task
** DONE resources in generated pom
* For 1.2.0
** DONE Fix self-build clean problem
** DONE Don't catch reader exceptions unless they are from ^D
** DONE document checkout dependencies
** DONE Re-enable rlwrap
** DONE Move the intro into a tutorial
** DONE bin script has stabilized; self-install for dev versions should work
** DONE accept list of namespaces to compile from command-line options
** DONE document version ranges
** DONE include lib/dev in find-lib-jars
** DONE document plugin creation
** DONE document all known project.clj keys
** DONE disable frickin [null] logging from ant (come on srsly)
** DONE recover from missing test exit map gracefully
** DONE Help task should display arglist
** DONE walk up the filesystem to find project.clj
** DONE make inter-task dependencies honor hooks
** DONE wire repl task up to socket repl
** DONE allow *warn-on-reflection* to be turned on in project.clj
** DONE Expose hooks in built-in tasks so plugins may extend them
** DONE make org.clojure implied for clojure/contrib deps
** DONE better way to force setFork in eval-in-project
** DONE rename :namespaces key in project.clj
** DONE include version in jar filenames
** DONE classpath task to just print configured classpath
** DONE move repl task from shell script to clojure code
* For 1.1.0
** DONE upgrade task (patch submitted)
** DONE doc generation (autodoc plugin)
* For 1.0
** DONE Remove install task dependency on having Maven installed       :Phil:
** DONE Use -Xbootclasspath where possible                              :Dan:
** DONE Don't write manifest, pom, etc. to disk when jarring           :Dan:
** DONE Don't put uberjar in ~/.m2                                     :Phil:
** DONE Perform compilation in either a subprocess or with a separate classloader
** DONE Allow test task to take namespaces as an argument
** DONE Fix eval-in-project to let plugins pass in extra args
** DONE Resources directory added to classpath (for properties, etc)
* Plugin ideas
** metrics
*** LOC
*** complexity
*** time logs
* Git-aware dependencies (experimental back-burner idea)
  Talking with Rich after Emerging Langs day 1
  Problem: you can pull in two versions of the same library
  transitively without realizing it if people fork on clojars. How do
  we detect this problem and de-dupe?
** What if artifacts could be correlated with the git rev that produced them?
** They have repository and sha1 metadata in their pom (but no history tree)
** Cross-correlate with a separate revision metadata store?
