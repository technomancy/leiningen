  Talking with Rich after Emerging Langs day 1
  Problem: you can pull in two versions of the same library
  transitively without realizing it if people fork on clojars. How do
  we detect this problem and de-dupe?
** What if artifacts could be correlated with the git rev that produced them?
** They have repository and sha1 metadata in their pom (but no history tree)
** Cross-correlate with a separate revision metadata store?
