* For 1.5.1
** TODO
   - [X] Move ns docstrings to :help-summary to allow AOT given CLJ-130.
   - [X] Put :eval-in-lein deps in lib/dev for leiningen process access.
   - [X] Revert back to :warn on checksum failure.
   - [X] Fix LEIN_ROOT warning in bin/lein.
   - [X] Honor user-settings in more places.
* For 1.5.0
  - unify auth options between :repositories and :deploy-to
  - suppress socket closed stacktrace in interactive task
  - checksum deps set; don't re-download if unchanged
  - allow whitelist for post-compile class file deletion
  - fix warn-on-reflection for repl task (#176)
  - explain how to do manual self-install if it fails
  - failure to upgrade leaves lein as a zero-length file (#153)
  - ensure project jar is last in uberjar (#178)
  - investigate uberjar slowdown? (#160)
* For 1.4.0
  - socket timing issues with interactive tests
  - connect to socket repl in interactive task
  - :uberjar-exclusions?
  - :all test-selector built-in
  - test selectors need to support things like constantly, complement
  - detect missing level of nesting in project.clj's deps/dev-deps
  - clear out non-transitive .class files after AOT
    Luc Prefontaine has code for this.
  - plugin task for managing/upgrading plugins
    Manually copying jar files into ~/.lein/plugins is pretty
    lame. Let's get a task to handle this. It could be implemented as a
    plugin at first, maybe.
  - merge lein-run task?
    Ditto; this is something useful that many projects need.
  - expose original pwd as property
  - merge lein-javac task
    Also make the compile task run it where appropriate.
  - test selectors using metadata; run a subset of tests
    We could have a :test-selectors key in project.clj that would map
    keywords to predicate functions. Then the test task could take a
    keyword argument and only run the subset of the tests for which
    calling the predicate on its metadata returns true.
* For 1.3.0
  - specify min. lein version in project.clj
  - :omit-source
  - lein install $PROJECT (works outside project root)
  - write shell wrappers on install
  - include shell wrapper in jar file from template
  - set arbitrary jar metadata
  - errors in read-project should show filename
  - user-level plugin installation and activation
  - user-level config file (with hook list)
  - get no-project-needed from arglist
  - argument chaining
  - interactive task
  - resources in generated pom
* For 1.2.0
  - Fix self-build clean problem
  - Don't catch reader exceptions unless they are from ^D
  - document checkout dependencies
  - Re-enable rlwrap
  - Move the intro into a tutorial
  - bin script has stabilized; self-install for dev versions should work
  - accept list of namespaces to compile from command-line options
  - document version ranges
  - include lib/dev in find-lib-jars
  - document plugin creation
  - document all known project.clj keys
  - disable frickin [null] logging from ant (come on srsly)
  - recover from missing test exit map gracefully
  - Help task should display arglist
  - walk up the filesystem to find project.clj
  - make inter-task dependencies honor hooks
  - wire repl task up to socket repl
  - allow \*warn-on-reflection\* to be turned on in project.clj
  - Expose hooks in built-in tasks so plugins may extend them
  - make org.clojure implied for clojure/contrib deps
  - better way to force setFork in eval-in-project
  - rename :namespaces key in project.clj
  - include version in jar filenames
  - classpath task to just print configured classpath
  - move repl task from shell script to clojure code
* For 1.1.0
  - upgrade task (patch submitted)
  - doc generation (autodoc plugin)
* For 1.0
  - Remove install task dependency on having Maven installed       :Phil:
  - Use -Xbootclasspath where possible                              :Dan:
  - Don't write manifest, pom, etc. to disk when jarring           :Dan:
  - Don't put uberjar in ~/.m2                                     :Phil:
  - Perform compilation in either a subprocess or with a separate classloader
  - Allow test task to take namespaces as an argument
  - Fix eval-in-project to let plugins pass in extra args
  - Resources directory added to classpath (for properties, etc)
* Plugin ideas
  - metrics
   - LOC
   - complexity
   - time logs
* Git-aware dependencies (experimental back-burner idea)
  Talking with Rich after Emerging Langs day 1
  Problem: you can pull in two versions of the same library
  transitively without realizing it if people fork on clojars. How do
  we detect this problem and de-dupe?
  - What if artifacts could be correlated with the git rev that produced them?
  - They have repository and sha1 metadata in their pom (but no history tree)
  - Cross-correlate with a separate revision metadata store?
